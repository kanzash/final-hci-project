## References

This application uses HTML/CSS/Javascript. I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) framework for the basic elements, and consulted their documentation so that I know how to integrate the elements according to my needs and my design. 

The icons used in this application are from the open source library of [Feathericons](https://feathericons.com).

Code snippet for timer functionality, which I had to adjust according to my use case: https://jsfiddle.net/robbmj/vpq5toeq/4/
